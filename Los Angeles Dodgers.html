 <p> After months of flying back and forth from California to Las Vegas, the
   Dodgers' journey is finally over. But they will not be retuning with what they set out for.
   The Dodgers offered Bryce Harper a big contract, but it wasn't enough for the
   super star to sign with them. </p>

<div class='content'>
   <h2> Contract </h2>
   <p> The rumorered contract the Dodgers offered Bryce included
     <ul>
       <li> Four or five years </li>
       <li> $45 million a year </li>
     </ul>
   <div class='footer'>
     If Bryce would have taken that offer, he would have broken the anaual average
     salary. But in the end, Bryce wanted a place to end his career, and the Dodgers weren't
     willing to take him into the long term. </p>
