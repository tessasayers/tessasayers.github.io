Where Will Bryce Go? 

If you were following MLB this off season (and even if you weren't), you probably heard the name Bryce Harper,
followed by the question, "Where will he go?" 

Bryce made fans and teams all across baseball wait in anticipation before he finally decided on what team he would 
be playing for... for the next 13 years. 

Becasue I am a Bryce Harper and MLB fan, I was following this closely. At times, the sweepstakes was hard to follow. 
This website allows you to see what teams were after Bryce, what they offered him and ultimately, where he ended up.
