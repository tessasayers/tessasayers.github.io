       <p> On February 28 news broke that Bryce Harper, a
         Major League Baseball
         outfielder, would end his free angency by singing with the
         Philadelphia
         Phillies. </p> </div>
     <div class='content'>
       <h2> Contract </h2>
       <p> The Phillies offered Bryce Harper a historic contract that includes
         <ul>
           <li>13 years</li>
           <li>$330 million, an average annual value of about $25 million</li>
           <li> No opt outs (Bryce is not allowed to optout of his contact) </li>
           <li> A no trade claus (No matter how he performes, the Phillies are
             <strong>not</strong> allowed to trade him) </li>
           </ul>

       <p> After spending his entire MLB career wearing number 34,
         the former NL MVP will be making another big change. Bryce Harper
         will be wearing number 3 with the Phillies.

         This change is not so much for his rebranding, but rather to honor
         the late Roy Halladay. The former Phillies' pitched died in a plane crash
         last year. </p>
