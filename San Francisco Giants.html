    <p> The San Francisco Giants were also in on the Bryce Harper sweepstakes. But,
      the super star didn't end up on the West Coast. While the Giants did offer him
      a life time contract, it just wasn't enough. </p>

      <h2> Contract </h2>
      <p> Most people would think you would be crazy to turn down an opportunity
        to get paid millions of dollars to play baseball in San Francisco. In that case,
        I guess would could say Bryce Harper is crazy. Here is what he is rumored to have
        turned down.
        <ul>
          <li> 12 years </li>
          <li> $310 million </li>
        </ul>
           <div class='footer'>
        Because of California taxes, the Giants would have had to shell out over $335 million
        to come close to the Phillies offer of $330 million. There were no rumors as to
        whether the Giants deal inclused a no trade claus or opt outs. </p>
